Implementation of DeePC

This repository contains the files used in the implementation of the DeePC algorithms.
It also contrains all python scrips used to conduct any experiment.

###
Important files:

- DeePC_OSQP.py          - This file contains the main implementation of the controller class.
- SimpleSystems.py       - This file contains the Classes for each simulated system and any additional 
		     	   Things that were simulated
- main_simple_system.py  - This file combines the controller with the simulated systems.
- Voltage_Controller.py  - This file contrains the hardware interface for the Voltage controller / hardware interface.
